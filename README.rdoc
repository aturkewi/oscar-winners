# Oscar Movie Winners

This repo is built to search through data and return Year-Title-Budget for all winning Oscar movies in the data. After doing this, it should also print out the average budget of all winners.

To run this code on your own machine, please do the following:
 - Fork and clone the repo to your machine
 - In the root dir of this cloned repo, run `bundle install` in your terminal. (Note: if you do not already have bundler, you can run `gem install bundler` first.)
 - To get the database started up, you will need to run `rake db:create` followed by `rake db:migrate`. (Note, if you do not already have a postgres server running on your computer, you will want to look into installing the software. I would recommend looking to use something like 'brew install postgres' and then checking here:'http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7975556/how-to-start-postgresql-server-on-mac-os-x' to find out how to start the server.)
 - Once your migrations are run, simply run `rake db:seed` to automatically access the API and load up the database.
